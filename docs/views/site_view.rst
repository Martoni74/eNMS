The geographical view displays all devices at their GPS coordinates. If several devices are colocated (e.g same building), they can be grouped in a site.
A site is a pool with a longitude and a latitude. The site view displays all sites on the map.

Clicking on a site will open a panel where all pool devices and links are organized in a logical and visually pleasing fashion using a force-based algorithm.
