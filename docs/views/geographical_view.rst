============
Network view
============

Once the network has been created, it can be displayed on a geographical map.

All devices are displayed on a map at their exact location (they must have been created with a longitude and latitude) on the map. The icon of a device and the color of a link depend on their type.

Marker Types
------------

There are three different types of markers: images, circle, and circle marker.
Images can take a lot of time to display if you have a big network; in that case, it is best to use circles or circle markers for scalability.

You can change the type of marker and tiles from the right-click menu.
You can also configure, from the :guilabel:`Admin / Administration Panel` page, which are used by default when you open the view.
