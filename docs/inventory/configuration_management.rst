Configuration Management
========================

eNMS can work as a network device configuration backup tool and replace Oxidized/Rancid with the following features:
  - Poll network elements; download configurations when they change
  - Easily view the current configuration of a device in the inventory
  - Search for any text in any configuration
  - View differences between various revisions of a configuration
  - Download device configuration to a local text file
  - Use the ReST API support to return a specified device's configuration
  - Export all device configurations to a remote Git repository (e.g. Gitlab)

Device configuration
--------------------

All devices are listed in the :guilabel:`Inventory / Configuration Management` page. By default, configurations are retrieved by a service called ``Configuration Backup Service``, which:
  - Uses Netmiko to fetch the configuration
  - Updates the device ``configuration`` property (a python dictionary that contains the most recent configurations)
  - Writes the configuration to a local text file (located in eNMS/files/git/data)

For some devices, the configuration cannot be retrieved with only a netmiko command. You can create your own configuration backup service(s) if need be. Targets are defined at the service level, like any other services.
A service intended to retrieve configurations must have a special ``configuration_backup_service`` set to True.
The service ``poller_service`` runs all services whose ``configuration_backup_service`` parameter is set to ``True``, as shown in the default configuration backup service `here <https://github.com/afourmy/eNMS/blob/master/eNMS/services/configuration_management/netmiko_backup_service.py#L26>`_

Configure polling
-----------------

The polling process is controlled by the ``Poller`` task. The ``Poller`` task is configured to run the ``Configuration Management Workflow``.

To configure the polling mechanism to run periodically, you need to go to the :guilabel:`Scheduling / Task Management` page and start the ``Poller`` task by pressing the ``Resume`` button.
By default, the ``Poller`` task will run every hour (3600 seconds), but you can change the frequency from the ``Edit`` form.

Search and display the configuration
------------------------------------

From the :guilabel:`Inventory / Device Management` and :guilabel:`Inventory / Configuration Management` pages, you can search for a specific word in the current configuration of all devices with the ``Advanced Search`` mechanism, column ``Current Configuration``. eNMS will filter the list of devices based on whether the current configuration of the device contains this word.
By clicking on the ``Configuration`` button, you can display and compare the device configurations.

All runs are stored in the ``Display`` and ``Compare With`` pull-down lists:
  - Selecting a run from ``Display`` will display the associated configuration.
  - Selecting a run from ``Compare With`` will compare the configuration with the one selected in ``Display``.

Comparing two configurations will display a git-like line-by-line diff similar to the one below:

Advanced
--------

- Number of configurations stored in the database: by default, eNMS stores the 10 most recent configurations in the database. The polling process is controlled by the ``configuration_backup`` service. You can change the number of stored configurations by changing the ``Number of configurations stored`` property.
- Configurations are retrieved with Netmiko. By default, eNMS uses the driver defined at device level to run the command. You can use a driver configured at service level instead, by unticking the ``Use driver from device`` check box.
- Configurations are pushed to the git 'configurations' repository automatically.
