Parameters common to the services that use netmiko
--------------------------------------------------

- ``Privileged mode`` If checked, Netmiko should enter enable mode on the device before applying the above configuration block 
- ``Driver`` Which Netmiko driver to use when connecting to the device
- ``Use driver from device`` If set to True, the driver defined at device level (``netmiko_driver`` property of the device) is used, otherwise the driver defined at service level (``driver`` property of the service) is used. By default, this property is set to ```True`` and eNMS uses the driver defined in the ``netmiko_driver`` property of the device. A **driver** can be selected among all available netmiko drivers. The list of drivers is built upon netmiko ``CLASS_MAPPER_BASE`` in ``ssh_dispatcher.py`` (https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko/blob/develop/netmiko/ssh_dispatcher.py#L69.
- ``Fast CLI`` If checked, Netmiko will disable internal wait states and delays in order to execute the service as fast as possible.
- ``Timeout`` Netmiko internal timeout in seconds to wait for a connection or response before declaring failure.
- ``Delay factor`` Netmiko multiplier used to increase internal delays (defaults to 1). Delay factor is used in the send_command Netmiko method. See here for more explanation: (https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/automation/netmiko-what-is-done.html)
- ``Global delay factor`` Netmiko multiplier used to increase internal delays (defaults to 1). Global delay factor affects more delays beyond Netmiko send_command. Increase this for devices that have trouble buffering and responding quickly.
- ``Strip command`` Remove the echo of the command from the output (default: True).
- ``Strip prompt`` Remove the trailing router prompt from the output (default: True).
- ``Auto Find Prompt``: Tries to detect the prompt automatically.

Parameters common to the services that use Napalm
-------------------------------------------------

- ``Driver`` Which Napalm driver to use when connecting to the device
- ``Use driver from device`` If set to True, the driver defined at device level (``napalm_driver`` property of the device) is used, otherwise the driver defined at service level (``driver`` property of the service) is used.
- ``Optional arguments`` Napalm supports a number of optional arguments that are documented here: (https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html#optional-arguments)

************************

An ``Ansible Playbook`` service sends an ansible playbook to the devices.
The output can be validated with a command / pattern mechanism, like the ``Netmiko Validation Service``.
An option allows inventory devices to be selected, such that the Ansible Playbook is run on each device in the selection. Another option allows device properties from the inventory to be passed to the ansible playbook as a dictionary.

Configuration parameters for creating this service instance:

- All Validation parameters (see above)
- ``Has Device Targets`` If checked, indicates that the selected inventory devices should be passed to the playbook as its inventory using -i. Alternatively, if not checked, the ansible playbook can reference its own inventory internally using host: inventory_group and by providing an alternative inventory
- ``playbook_path`` path and filename to the Ansible Playbook. For example, if the playbooks subdirectory is located inside the eNMS project directory:  playbooks/juniper_get_facts.yml
- ``arguments`` ansible-playbook command line options, which are documented here: (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/cli/ansible-playbook.html)
- ``options`` Additional --extra-vars to be passed to the playbook using the syntax {'key1':value1, 'key2': value2}.  All inventory properties are automatically passed to the playbook using --extra-vars (if pass_device_properties is selected below). These options are appended.
- ``Pass device properties to the playbook`` Pass inventory properties using --extra-vars to the playbook if checked (along with the options dictionary provided above).

.. note:: This Service supports variable substitution (as mentioned in the previous section) in the `playbook_path` and `content_match` input fields of its configuration form.

REST Call Service

- ``Type of call`` REST type operation to be performed: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- ``URL`` URL to make the REST connection to
- ``Payload`` The data to be sent in POST Or PUT operation
- ``Parameters`` Additional parameters to pass in the request. From the requests library, params can be a dictionary, list of tuples or bytes that are sent in the body of the request.
- ``Headers`` Dictionary of HTTP Header information to send with the request, such as the type of data to be passed. For example, {"accept":"application/json","content-type":"application/json"}
- ``Verify SSL Certificate`` If checked (default), the SSL certificate is verified.
- ``Timeout`` Requests library timeout, which is the Float value in seconds to wait for the server to send data before giving up

- ``Direction`` Get or Put the file from/to the target device's filesystem
- ``Protocol`` Use SCP or SFTP to perform the transfer
- ``Source file`` For Get, source file is the path-plus-filename on the device to retrieve to the eNMS server. For Put, source file is the path-plus-filename on the eNMS server to send to the device.
- ``Destination file`` For Get, destination file is the path-plus-filename on the eNMS server to store the file to. For Put, destination file is the path-plus-filename on the device to store the file to.
- ``Missing Host Key Policy`` If checked, auto-add the host key policy on the ssh connection
- ``Load known host keys`` If checked, load host keys on the eNMS server before attempting the connection
- ``Look for keys`` Flag that is passed to the paramiko ssh connection to indicate if the library should look for host keys or ignore.
- ``Source file includes glob pattern (Put Direction only)`` Flag indicates that for Put Direction transfers only, the above Source file field contains a Glob pattern match (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) for selecting multiple files for transport. When Globing is used, the Destination file directory should only contain a destination directory, because the source file names will be re-used at the destination.

.. note:: This Service supports variable substitution (as mentioned in the previous section) in the `url` and `content_match` input fields of its configuration form.

Ping Service
************
